# COMP6443SomethingAwesome
This is the demo for my COMP6443 something awesome project, the details in the "ProjectIntro.pdf", feel free to check it, and the paddingoracle.py is the demo code for cracking a simple ciphertext using CBC-DES mode.


Also, I got some exercises for padding oracles and I write the solution in the "PaddingOraclesExercises.pdf", to help the visiors and I to review later.

** If you can not view the pdf online ,please download it in your local machine and open it.
